## Description
*Short description of the proposal. Is it a new encoding? Is it backwards compatible (old readers will just ignore it)? Is it additional metadata?*

## Rationale
Describe why this is a feature that will improve the parquet format and what alternatives currently exist for the use case (e.g. must use a different format, or "must build additional infrastructure to avoid re-parsing footer on each query", or "must use a general purpose compression algorithm to achieve the same space, thus slowing down query performance")

## Spec

At the proposal stage you don't need a fully fleshed out spec yet. 
Please add any link to relevant documentation, papers, etc.
at the implementation stage, the details will need to be all clarified.

## Evaluation
What datasets is it tested on and what is a success criteria 
Please add any link to the relevant codebase.
