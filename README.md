Parquet [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Parquet/parquet-format.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/Parquet/parquet-format)
======
Parquet is a columnar storage format that supports nested data.

Parquet metadata is encoded using Apache Thrift.

The `Parquet-format` project contains all Thrift definitions that are necessary to create readers
and writers for Parquet files.

## Motivation

We created Parquet to make the advantages of compressed, efficient columnar data representation available to any project in the Hadoop ecosystem.

Parquet is built from the ground up with complex nested data structures in mind, and uses the [record shredding and assembly algorithm](https://github.com/Parquet/parquet-mr/wiki/The-striping-and-assembly-algorithms-from-the-Dremel-paper) described in the Dremel paper. We believe this approach is superior to simple flattening of nested name spaces.

Parquet is built to support very efficient compression and encoding schemes. Multiple projects have demonstrated the performance impact of applying the right compression and encoding scheme to the data. Parquet allows compression schemes to be specified on a per-column level, and is future-proofed to allow adding more encodings as they are invented and implemented.

Parquet is built to be used by anyone. The Hadoop ecosystem is rich with data processing frameworks, and we are not interested in playing favorites. We believe that an efficient, well-implemented columnar storage substrate should be useful to all frameworks without the cost of extensive and difficult to set up dependencies.

## Modules

The `parquet-format` project contains format specifications and Thrift definitions of metadata required to properly read Parquet files.

The `parquet-mr` project contains multiple sub-modules, which implement the core components of reading and writing a nested, column-oriented data stream, map this core onto the parquet format, and provide Hadoop Input/Output Formats, Pig loaders, and other java-based utilities for interacting with Parquet.

The `parquet-compatibility` project contains compatibility tests that can be used to verify that implementations in different languages can read and write each other's files.

## Building

Java resources can be build using `mvn package`. The current stable version should always be available from Maven Central.

C++ thrift resources can be generated via make.

Thrift can be also code-genned into any other thrift-supported language.

## Glossary
  - Block (HDFS block): This means a block in HDFS and the meaning is 
    unchanged for describing this file format.  The file format is 
    designed to work well on top of HDFS.

  - File: A HDFS file that must include the metadata for the file.
    It does not need to actually contain the data.

  - Row group: A logical horizontal partitioning of the data into rows.
    There is no physical structure that is guaranteed for a row group.
    A row group consists of a column chunk for each column in the dataset.

  - Column chunk: A chunk of the data for a particular column.  They live
    in a particular row group and are guaranteed to be contiguous in the file.

  - Page: Column chunks are divided up into pages.  A page is conceptually
    an indivisible unit (in terms of compression and encoding).  There can
    be multiple page types which are interleaved in a column chunk.

Hierarchically, a file consists of one or more row groups.  A row group
contains exactly one column chunk per column.  Column chunks contain one or
more pages. 

## Unit of parallelization
  - MapReduce - File/Row Group
  - IO - Column chunk
  - Encoding/Compression - Page

## File format
This file and the [thrift definition](src/main/thrift/parquet.thrift) should be read together to understand the format.

    4-byte magic number "PAR1"
    <Column 1 Chunk 1 + Column Metadata>
    <Column 2 Chunk 1 + Column Metadata>
    ...
    <Column N Chunk 1 + Column Metadata>
    <Column 1 Chunk 2 + Column Metadata>
    <Column 2 Chunk 2 + Column Metadata>
    ...
    <Column N Chunk 2 + Column Metadata>
    ...
    <Column 1 Chunk M + Column Metadata>
    <Column 2 Chunk M + Column Metadata>
    ...
    <Column N Chunk M + Column Metadata>
    File Metadata
    4-byte length in bytes of file metadata (little endian)
    4-byte magic number "PAR1"

In the above example, there are N columns in this table, split into M row 
groups.  The file metadata contains the locations of all the column metadata 
start locations.  More details on what is contained in the metadata can be found 
in the thrift definition.

Metadata is written after the data to allow for single pass writing.

Readers are expected to first read the file metadata to find all the column 
chunks they are interested in.  The columns chunks should then be read sequentially.

## Metadata
There are three types of metadata: file metadata, column (chunk) metadata and page
header metadata.  All thrift structures are serialized using the TCompactProtocol.

## Types
The types supported by the file format are intended to be as minimal as possible,
with a focus on how the types effect on disk storage.  For example, 16-bit ints
are not explicitly supported in the storage format since they are covered by
32-bit ints with an efficient encoding.  This reduces the complexity of implementing
readers and writers for the format.  The types are:
  - BOOLEAN: 1 bit boolean
  - INT32: 32 bit signed ints
  - INT64: 64 bit signed ints
  - INT96: 96 bit signed ints
  - FLOAT: IEEE 32-bit floating point values
  - DOUBLE: IEEE 64-bit floating point values
  - BYTE_ARRAY: arbitrarily long byte arrays.

### Logical Types
Logical types are used to extend the types that parquet can be used to store,
by specifying how the primitive types should be interpreted. This keeps the set
of primitive types to a minimum and reuses parquet's efficient encodings. For
example, strings are stored as byte arrays (binary) with a UTF8 annotation.
These annotations define how to further decode and interpret the data.
Annotations are stored as `ConvertedType` fields in the file metadata and are
documented in
[LogicalTypes.md][logical-types].

[logical-types]: LogicalTypes.md

## Nested Encoding
To encode nested columns, Parquet uses the Dremel encoding with definition and 
repetition levels.  Definition levels specify how many optional fields in the 
path for the column are defined.  Repetition levels specify at what repeated field
in the path has the value repeated.  The max definition and repetition levels can
be computed from the schema (i.e. how much nesting there is).  This defines the
maximum number of bits required to store the levels (levels are defined for all
values in the column).  

Two encodings for the levels are supported BIT_PACKED and RLE. Only RLE is now used as it supersedes BIT_PACKED.

## Nulls
Nullity is encoded in the definition levels (which is run-length encoded).  NULL values 
are not encoded in the data.  For example, in a non-nested schema, a column with 1000 NULLs 
would be encoded with run-length encoding (0, 1000 times) for the definition levels and
nothing else.  

## Data Pages
For data pages, the 3 pieces of information are encoded back to back, after the page
header.  We have the 
 - repetition levels data, 
 - definition levels data,  
 - encoded values.

The value of `uncompressed_page_size` specified in the header is for all 3 pieces combined.

The data for the data page is always required.  The definition and repetition levels
are optional, based on the schema definition.  If the column is not nested (i.e.
the path to the column has length 1), we do not encode the repetition levels (it would
always have the value 1).  For data that is required, the definition levels are
skipped (if encoded, it will always have the value of the max definition level). 

For example, in the case where the column is non-nested and required, the data in the
page is only the encoded values.

The supported encodings are described in [Encodings.md](https://github.com/Parquet/parquet-format/blob/master/Encodings.md)

## Column chunks
Column chunks are composed of pages written back to back.  The pages share a common 
header and readers can skip over pages they are not interested in.  The data for the 
page follows the header and can be compressed and/or encoded.  The compression and 
encoding is specified in the page metadata.

## Checksumming
Data pages can be individually checksummed.  This allows disabling of checksums at the 
HDFS file level, to better support single row lookups.

## Error recovery
If the file metadata is corrupt, the file is lost.  If the column metadata is corrupt, 
that column chunk is lost (but column chunks for this column in other row groups are 
okay).  If a page header is corrupt, the remaining pages in that chunk are lost.  If 
the data within a page is corrupt, that page is lost.  The file will be more 
resilient to corruption with smaller row groups.

Potential extension: With smaller row groups, the biggest issue is placing the file 
metadata at the end.  If an error happens while writing the file metadata, all the 
data written will be unreadable.  This can be fixed by writing the file metadata 
every Nth row group.  
Each file metadata would be cumulative and include all the row groups written so 
far.  Combining this with the strategy used for rc or avro files using sync markers, 
a reader could recover partially written files.  

## Separating metadata and column data.
The format is explicitly designed to separate the metadata from the data.  This
allows splitting columns into multiple files, as well as having a single metadata
file reference multiple parquet files.  

## Configurations
- Row group size: Larger row groups allow for larger column chunks which makes it 
possible to do larger sequential IO.  Larger groups also require more buffering in 
the write path (or a two pass write).  We recommend large row groups (512MB - 1GB). 
Since an entire row group might need to be read, we want it to completely fit on 
one HDFS block.  Therefore, HDFS block sizes should also be set to be larger.  An 
optimized read setup would be: 1GB row groups, 1GB HDFS block size, 1 HDFS block 
per HDFS file.
- Data page size: Data pages should be considered indivisible so smaller data pages 
allow for more fine grained reading (e.g. single row lookup).  Larger page sizes 
incur less space overhead (less page headers) and potentially less parsing overhead 
(processing headers).  Note: for sequential scans, it is not expected to read a page 
at a time; this is not the IO chunk.  We recommend 8KB for page sizes.

## Extensibility
There are many places in the format for compatible extensions:
- File Version: The file metadata contains a version.
- Encodings: Encodings are specified by enum and more can be added in the future.  
- Page types: Additional page types can be added and safely skipped.
